## Web Server
## Create a server that returns 3 routes. If someone performs a get request to / your server should return the index.html file from the last group last project.If someone performs a get request to /yourname (swap with your first name) the server should return your personal html file from the group project. If someone performs a post request to /comment your server should parse the data from the post request body and send the text data back to the client.In order to do this you can use Express like we talked about in class or a server of your choice in a different language. Feel free to ask for help with your old group mates but everyone will need to submit individually. Once you've completed it, upload the server code to github and fill in this link with your info!
